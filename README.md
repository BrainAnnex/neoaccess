# THIS STANDALONE LIBRAY IS OBSOLETE!  It has been re-absorbed into the parent project [brainannex](https://github.com/BrainAnnex/brain-annex), and renamed "GraphAccess" 

### High-level python interface to the Neo4j graph database

https://brainannex.org/guide.php


This now-obsolete standalone library was spinned off from the parent project "Brain Annex",
but got re-absorbed into it in 2025.

To use it, just `pip install neoaccess`   [**NOT RECOMMENDED ANYMORE** : instead, use the latest version, now renamed "GraphAccess"
and part of the `brainannex` library, available in 2 versions - for Neo4j version 4 and version 5]

Notes:

- This obsolete library is for versions 4.x of the Neo4j database (supported only on 4.4).  By contrast, the new version (renamed "GraphAccess")
also supports versions 5.x of the Neo4j database - and is expected to also support other graph databases in the future

- The APOC library must be installed on Neo4j to use the function export_dbase_json()
